<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies Curriculum is the preparation of our students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks to ignite students' curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The Curriculum therefore envisions students as informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>
<p>At Fuchun Secondary School, team Humanities seeks to spark the interest of students through a conceptual teaching approach centred on a number of initiatives and activities:&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>UNFAIR TRADE: THE CARD GAME</strong></h4>
<p>A popular game developed in-house by our teachers, it is used to teach the economic impact of globalisation. It involves students playing the roles of leaders of countries in an exciting session of trading and coveting resources, in order to gain an upper hand in the global race for economic supremacy. The game has gotten quite a number of favourable reviews, with the added effect of helping students understand the significance and effects of global trade on both developed and developing nations.</p>

<h4><strong>YOUTH MODEL ASEAN CONFERENCE 2019</strong></h4>
<p>Several students were selected to attend the simulated session of the ASEAN, where our students acted as delegates of Australia to discuss hot-button issues and negotiating a way to collaborate with other countries to achieve a common goal. This allowed our students to gain a deeper understanding of current issues affecting the ASEAN region, and learn additional skills such as public speaking, negotiation and research!</p>

<h4><strong>CPF EXHIBITION 2019</strong></h4>
<p>We had an exhibition by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) to help our students understand the importance and relevance of CPF to everyone towards maintaining a nest egg that can help them in getting their first home! Our students were grouped to play a game of which they had to &lsquo;put a roof over their heads&rsquo; by amassing sufficient funds in their CPF. The students really enjoyed themselves and learnt something valuable!</p>
