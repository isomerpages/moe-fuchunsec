<p>History provides us a way of thinking about the past. The use of historical inquiry shows students a way to inquire into, organise and explain events that have happened. Historical inquiry is the process of &ldquo;doing history&rdquo;. It is a cyclical process that begins with the asking of guiding historical questions. This is followed by locating and analysing historical sources to establish historical evidence. The historical evidence is then used to construct historical interpretations that seek to answer the guiding historical questions.</p>
<p>The use of historical inquiry is thus at the heart of history instruction and learning, and students must be provided with the opportunities to learn the skills required through practice and engagement in historical inquiry. The use of an inquiry question in each unit provides the focal point for students to investigate, extract, order, collate, synthesise and analyse information to formulate and test&nbsp;hypothesis&nbsp;and reach a conclusion explored in the syllabus.</p>
<p>There are six generic questions to further guide students in their inquiry to the issues and topics covered in the syllabus:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were the major forces and developments during this period?</li>
<li>What caused these major forces and developments?</li>
<li>Who were the key players involved?</li>
<li>How did the developments influence peoples&rsquo; decisions and actions and vice-versa?</li>
<li>How did people&rsquo;s views and perspectives shape their interpretation of these developments?</li>
<li>How did these developments impact societies?</li>
<li>The inquiry approach, when implemented effectively, can develop critical thinkers and independent learners.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>SECONDARY 1 LEARNING-ON-THE-MOVE CHINATOWN TRAIL</strong></h4>
<p>Our Secondary 1 History students had a chance to explore the one of the pre-war neighbourhoods in Singapore, namely Chinatown, where many buildings still bear the same fa&ccedil;ade since 1900s! Through this learning journey, our students got a chance to understand how the early immigrants lived their lives while sharing the same neighbourhood with people from other races and walks of life!</p>
