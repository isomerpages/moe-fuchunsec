<p>In line with the Geography syllabus and its new focus on Geographical Inquiry (GI) through fieldwork, students at Fuchun Secondary are given ample opportunities to venture out of the classroom and investigate real-world issues through the Geographic lenses.</p>

<p>Through our Investigative Fieldwork sessions, students are exposed to techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crafting hypothesis for research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data collection methods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Indoor &amp; Outdoor Atmospheric Quality Assessment (Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Air Pressure, Light Exposure)</li>
<li>Water Quality Assessment (Temperature, pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen)</li>
<li>Field Photography</li>
<li>Field Sketching</li>
<li>Crafting questionnaire and conducting interviews</li>
<li>Land use survey</li>
<li>Tally counting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data representation methods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bar graphs, Line graph, Pie charts, Maps, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>In addition, such Investigative Fieldwork sessions&nbsp;develops&nbsp;our students&rsquo; ability in making&nbsp;<strong>independent observation, reasoned judgment</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>reflective thinking</strong>. As our students are tasked to work in investigation groups, they also learn&nbsp;social&nbsp;skills necessary for a team to work collaboratively and effectively.</p>
<p>Our teachers work hard to ensure that such experiences encourage our students to&nbsp;<strong>question, investigate and critically think</strong>&nbsp;about issues affecting the environment and people&rsquo;s lives in the most&nbsp;<strong>authentic and meaningful</strong>&nbsp;manner.</p>
