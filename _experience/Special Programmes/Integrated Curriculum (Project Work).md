<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Integrated Project Work is a collaborative curriculum of the English Language, CCE&nbsp;Departments. IPW facilitates students in preparation for Upper Secondary, by inculcating&nbsp;the&nbsp;spirit&nbsp;of inquiry in our students in Secondary 2. The inquiry methodology of IPW reinforces&nbsp;the&nbsp;school&rsquo;s&nbsp;vision for every student to be &lsquo;A Learner, A Leader and An Explorer&rsquo;.&nbsp;IPW seeks to strengthen students&rsquo;&nbsp;21st century&nbsp;competencies through applied learning experiences&nbsp;and the equipping of life-skills through its collaborative nature. IPW aims to provide opportunities in&nbsp;the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>To train students to be confident communicators, self-directed learners and team collaborators</li>
<li>To help students make connections across different disciplines (EL and Service to School)</li>
<li>To instil in students a sense of belonging to the school by having a voice in identify the needs of the school and implementing changes that will benefit the school community.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Integrated Curriculum</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Planning Phase</strong></p>
<p>Students are presented with a problem, to identify a school need and present a proposal for an improvement to benefit the school population. Students during their EL lessons are taught the fundamentals of writing a good proposal and verbal presentation. The top 2 presentations per class are shortlisted to be presented to the Principal who selects one of the proposals to be implemented as a class.</p>
<p><strong>Project Implementation Phase</strong></p>
<p>The selected proposal is implemented with the collaboration and involvement of the entire class. Students are re-grouped to assume different roles for the successful implementation of the project. The school ICARE values are re-enforced throughout the implementation phase.</p>
<p>Though the Project Work Assessment is only meant for the Secondary 2 Express and Normal Academic Students, the Normal Technical students experience the entire project planning and project implementation phase as well.</p>
