<p><strong>Our Vision<br /></strong>Fuchun Secondary, an Environmentally Caring School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fuchun school community and various stakeholders showed their commitment in conducting its programmes, activities and operations in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. Programmes impacting the school community can be categorised into mainly two groups: Curriculum and Co-curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum:<br /></strong>Here environmental awareness were explicitly taught in the Science and Geography syllabus. Students acted on being environmentally caring through by participating in the weekly Recycling Challenge Programme. The Green Club members advocated on care for the environment by giving sharing on green messages weekly during the morning assembly. The sharing was on environmental issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy saving</li>
<li>Water conservation</li>
<li>Waste management and recycling&nbsp;</li>
<li>Green living</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Co-curriculum:<br /></strong>The Green Club programme took the centrestage in green movement in the school. The activities in the club allowed the students to heighten their awareness of biodiversity and environmental issues such as water resources through visits to places like Sungei Buloh and Marina Barrage.</p>
<p>Environmentally focussed activities are not exclusive to the CCA group. The other CCA groups further strengthened our conviction towards being environmentally caring by incorporating green activities as part of the CCA VIA programmes. In addition, special groups participated in environmentally-related competitions and events.</p>
<p>The school also worked with partners outside the school, such as NParks, WWF, NWCDC as its students had spread the value of being environmentally minded with much joy to the members of public. For example, during the Northwest Clean &amp; Green Workshop Programme and R Cube project. Staff of Fuchun took part in a nature walk facilitated by its own staff, while NParks also shared on the value of nature parks designated as buffer zones for the central nature reserves. This was much welcomed by the NParks as they engaged the school for other projects in the following year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a school policy, all printed materials were defaulted for double-sided printing and printing requests had to be approved by the school leaders.</p>
