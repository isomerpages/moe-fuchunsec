<p><strong>VALUES THROUGH DANCE</strong><br /><strong>DESIRED STUDENT OUTCOMES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students who enjoy and experience the arts as audience and participants.</li>
<li>Students who develop interests, talents and character through arts engagement.</li>
<li>Students with greater aptitude lead in dance activities and represent school on national platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PROGRAMME</strong></p>
<p>Our Values through Dance Programme seeks to inculcate values, including school values, through the use of dance in various forms. While the student acquires the knowledge and learns the skills associated with dance, central to the nurturing of the student are the values that will serve to anchor the character development through&nbsp;<strong>exposure, experience and engagement.</strong></p>
<p>The identified values will be nurtured in 3 aspects:</p>

<p>Our LLP is&nbsp;<strong>in alignment to the school&rsquo;s strategic thrust 2, Excellence in Co-Curriculum</strong>, with one of the goals as developing in students the values, skills, awareness, appreciation and talent through performing arts, in particular, dance where it has been the stronghold of the performing arts in school.</p>
<p>Through the curriculum and co-curriculum, within school, in the community and even beyond our shores, many platforms avail for us to develop values and skills through our LLP.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3 tiers of development are:</strong></p>
