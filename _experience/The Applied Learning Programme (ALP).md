<p><strong>INNOVATIONS IN SCIENCE &amp;TECHNOLOGY FOR SUSTAIN-ABILITY</strong></p>
<p>Our ALP is anchored on cultivating students&rsquo; interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and developing their strengths and talents further to pursue careers in related fields in the future.</p>
<p>Modelling and simulation seeks to&nbsp;<strong>mould intellectually curious, inquiring and imaginative team players, problem solvers steeped in values with an interest in the application of the sciences and technology</strong>&nbsp;in the real world for&nbsp;<strong>sustainable living, work and play</strong>.</p>
<p>We seek to hone our students&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong>critical and inventive thinking skills, foster innovation</strong>&nbsp;and enhance their&nbsp;<strong>ability to solve problems</strong>. To achieve these goals, our instructional programme actively integrates&nbsp;<strong>Computational Thinking</strong>&nbsp;(CT) and we guide our students to learn the four basic steps of Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design.</p>
<p>Through our ALP, a tiered approach is used to design a suite of enriching learning experiences for our students.</p>

<p><u>Tier 1</u>: In Secondary 1, all students engage in&nbsp;<strong>digital making using micro:bits</strong>&nbsp;to solve real-world problems on sustainability. In Secondary 2, they continue to extend and expand on their knowledge in coding and programming through mBots. Our students can also look forward to an&nbsp;<strong>exciting line-up of learning journeys and experiential learning workshops</strong>&nbsp;to pique their interests in STEM, and explore STEM-related higher education and career opportunities.</p>
<p><u>Tier 2</u>: Students who demonstrate strengths, talents and interests in our Tier 1 programmes are offered a stretching opportunities by participating in&nbsp;<strong>STEM-related workshops</strong>&nbsp;at a higher level of mastery and representing&nbsp;<strong>our&nbsp;school in showcases and competitions</strong>.</p>
<p>Students will also get to learn about&nbsp;<strong>Computational Thinking</strong>&nbsp;(CT), comprising the four basic steps of Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design, as teachers integrate these steps meaningfully into teaching and learning.</p>
<p><em><u>Some highlights of past engagements:</u></em></p>
<p><strong>ALP In-House Learning Journey</strong></p>
<p>To provide a richer experience for our Secondary 3 students under our Tier 1 ALP programme, the school worked with our partner, M/s Dream Catcher Technologies Pte Ltd, to conduct an in-house learning journey. The students deepened their understanding of robotics with hands-on experiences with airblock, mBots and MakeBlock. The English Department also took the opportunity to further engage the students by having the 3 express students do a write-up on the event as their Task-Based Assignment.</p>

<p>Two teams of students participated in&nbsp;<strong>Maker Faire 2018 (17 &ndash; 19 Aug 2018)</strong>, where they&nbsp;<strong>showcased their robots conceptualised, designed and built by them.</strong> Both robots were the result of months of hard work, perseverance, innovation and resourcefulness. The experience was enriching for the students as they get to interact, share and receive feedback from the public.</p>

<p><strong>ALP Programme featured on &ldquo;The Big Question &ndash; The Future of Work&rdquo; (Channel News Asia broadcast on 18 Mar 2018), media visit by MOE Communications Division, Communications and Engagement Group.</strong></p>
<p>Our ALP programme was highlighted through the different media broadcast. The experiences boosted school pride for the students and strengthened their belief and interest in STEM-related fields. More details can be obtained through the following web links.</p>

<p>Our students continue to make waves in the&nbsp;<strong>Ngee Ann Polytechnic Marine &amp; Offshore Challenge 2018 Competition</strong>&nbsp;clinching the following prizes with our in-house designs made in our very own DEEP lab. The 3D printers allowed students to create, fabricate models, test, develop and refine their prototypes as they find the winning solution.</p>
<p><u><strong>SHIP CATEGORY<br /></strong></u>1. Most innovative hull design award&nbsp;Gold<br />2. Most innovative propulsion design award&nbsp;Gold<br />3. Best performance Ship award&nbsp;Silver</p>
<p><strong><u>SUBMARINE CATEGORY<br /></u></strong>1. Best performance Sub award&nbsp;Silver<br />2. Best Aesthetics &amp; workmanship award&nbsp;Gold</p>

<p><strong>Overseas Learning Journey to Shen Zhen, China</strong></p>
<p>Our students had an immersive 4D3N experience where they visited Makeblock (who designed and markets mBots and Airblocks) and schools in Shen Zhen that integrated robotics in education. The trip provided the students the opportunity to interact with some of the designers in MakeBlock, who shared on their work ethics and passion as well as how they keep their creative juices flowing by having fun design competitions in their workplace. The interaction with student counterparts in China strengthened our students&rsquo; commitment to face challenges in a VUCA environment, to be humble in receiving feedback and to be courageous to try out new ideas.</p>
