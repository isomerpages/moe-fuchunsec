<p>The Girl Guides is part of an International movement which strives to develop our girls to their fullest potential as responsible citizens. The weekly training sessions are based on a Five-Point program which encompasses Personal and Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International. Apart from the Five-Point program, the girls engage in proficiency badge work as well as participate actively in HQ-based activities to develop their leadership skills.</p>
