<p><strong><u>Vision<br /></u></strong>An Environmentally Friendly Club that Advocates Love for Nature</p>
<p><strong><u>About Us<br /></u></strong>The Green Club programme allowed the members to heighten their awareness of biodiversity and environmental issues such as water resources through visits to places like Sungei Buloh and Marina Barrage. Environmentally focussed activities helped to strengthen members&rsquo; conviction towards being environmentally caring.</p>
<p>Green Club also worked with partners outside the school, such as NParks, WWF, NWCDC as its members helped to spread the value of being environmentally minded to the members of public. From time to time, environmental issues such as the following were also discussed during CCA sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy saving</li>
<li>Water conservation</li>
<li>Waste management and recycling</li>
<li>Biodiversity</li>
</ul>
