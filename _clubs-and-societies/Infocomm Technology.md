We seek to equip our students with 21st century skills and develop them to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.</p><p>In line with this vision, student members of the Infocomm Technology (Media Production) are trained in techniques of photography, filming, video journalism and in the use of editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and iMovie in their four to five years in the club. To further test and hone their acquired skills, members are exposed to various competition platforms such as the “Our School, Our Stories Competition”, SGPY Photo Competition by NParks Competitions, online Photo Competitions (Photocrowd), etc.</p><p>Since 2012, the Infocomm Club has four areas in which students are exposed to. They are in Digital Video, Video Journalism, Photography and the Public Address system. Our Infocomm Club members are also continually learning and adding on to their repertoire of skills as well as enhancing their technical industry knowledge. This is achieved through their use of the equipment, active participation in Learning Journeys, workshops and short courses organised by polytechnics and JCs.</p><p><strong><u>Achievements</u></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Participated in Young Weather Photographer of the Year 2022 contest on Photocrowd</p></li><li><p>Participated in online Photography Competitions on Photocrowd</p></li><li><p>SGPY photo competition 2019 by NParks - Participation</p></li><li><p>Our School, Our Stories Competition 2019 - Participation</p></li><li><p>Our School, Our Stories Competition 2018 (6 teams) - Participation</p></li><li><p>Youth Video Competition 2018 (organized by Jurong West Police Division) - Participation</p></li></ul><p><strong><u>Events</u></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Learning Journey to Marina Barrage - 1 Apr 2019</p></li><li><p>Kallang Waterways VIA - 4 Mar 2019</p></li><li><p>Food Ration Pledging VIA Project with Nam Hong Welfare Charity Event - Aug 2018</p></li><li><p>The Documentary Production Experience (10 Sessions) by Kelvin Sng Productions</p></li><li><p>Shooting event video and photography at Fuchun Fiesta 2018 @Kallang Threatre</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/info2.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/info6.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2024_01_10_at_08_39_52.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2024_01_10_at_08_39_51.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2024_01_10_at_08_39_51__1_.jpeg"></div><p></p><p></p>
