SALES OF SCHOOL UNIFORMS
------------------------

   

Due to the school merger at the end of 2024 with Woodlands Ring Secondary School, our previous supplier are no longer producing any uniforms.

Fortunately, we are able to forge a new partnership with Chop Kong Chong to provide us part of the uniform such as pants/culotte, black shorts, socks and shoes. Do take note that the colour/shade may differ from the original uniforms.

Please see table for more details.
