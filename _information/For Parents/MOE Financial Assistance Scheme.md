MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME INFORMATION
===========================================

Singapore Citizens in financial need can get assistance from MOE on school fees and other expenses. 

  

From 1 January 2023, Singapore Citizen students from households with gross **monthly household income (GHI) of $3,000 and below, or per capita income (PCI) of $750 and below**, will be eligible for the MOE FAS.

  

MOE FAS recipients are not required to pay school fees and standard miscellaneous fees. Those in primary and secondary schools are also **eligible for free textbooks, school attire, meals and transport subsidies**.

  

You can submit your application online via the [MOE eFAS Online Application](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas) if you are eligible and wish to apply for the MOE FAS. To check on your eligibility, go to [MOE FAS](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance) Alternatively, you may submit the completed [MOE FAS Application Form](https://fuchunsec-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/qql/slot/u371/Parents/MOE%20FAS%20Application%20Form.docx) to the school.  

  

Please contact the school General Office at 63681984 if you have any enquiries.  

  
**Important Notes**

If your child is a ComCare recipient, you need not submit the application for MOE FAS as MOE FAS will be auto-granted to ComCare beneficiaries in Government and Government-Aided Schools (GGAS).
