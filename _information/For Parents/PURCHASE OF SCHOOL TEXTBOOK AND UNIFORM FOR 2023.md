**Dear Parents,**

Due to the ongoing pandemic and in concert with the nation-wide effort to prevent local transmission, we require all visits to the school to be managed in a controlled manner so as to ensure the safety of all members in our community.  Towards this end, we are bringing the sales of school uniform and textbooks for the academic year 2022 online in a bid to minimize the likelihood of group mingling and reduce extensive physical contact.

  

You may now start placing your orders with our appointed suppliers through their online portals.  Our suppliers will offer 2 options for you to receive your orders.  You can either pay a flat transport fee to have your purchases delivered to home or book a time slot for self-collection. We are enforcing safe distancing and visitor control measures so any collection in person can only be done strictly by appointment and walk-in - whether for purchase and any unscheduled collection - will only be allowed if the crowd situation permits. Depending on the appointment volume, walk-in customers could potentially experience longer waiting time at the designated holding area and we therefore urge you to purchase online and opt for either home delivery or self-collection by appointment to avoid the hassle.
