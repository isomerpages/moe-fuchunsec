<p><strong><u>About Us<br></u></strong>At our guitar ensemble, we believe that every student deserves and has the ability to pick up skills which will be relevant and useful in their future.</p>
<p>Besides learning guitar skills, teachers and instructors aim to inculcate values which we hope that our students would grow to become a better person. We acknowledge that all students are different and we try our best to engage them in ways that they can perform optimally.</p>

<p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival 2017<br></u></strong>Our Guitar Ensemble was well-prepared and had demonstrated considerable artistry, making for an engaging listening experience. There was a good balance of exciting rhythmic vitality and refined sensitivity.</p>
<p>Our players performed at a high standard of precision and harmonic support. Their performance exuded musicality and carefully-planned interpretations that utilised clear sectional contrasts of dynamic texture and colour.</p>
<p>Indeed a well-deserved Certificate of Distinction for our Guitar Ensemble teachers and students.</p>
