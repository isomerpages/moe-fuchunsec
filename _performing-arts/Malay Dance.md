<p><strong><u>Introduction<br /></u></strong>Amra &ndash; Weapon. Tari &ndash; Dance. In the literal sense, the Malay dance is Amra Tari&rsquo;s weapon to advocate the beauty of the Malay culture to the community. Through dance, we aspire to instil a great love for dance among our students, while inspiring self-confidence, discipline and respect of the Malay dance and culture.</p>

<p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival 2017<br /></u></strong>Chances are, you have never seen anything like Amra Tari&rsquo;s stellar performance in the recent SYF. It had been a truly remarkable, very high-energy performance with its distinct style, the Samra. The group showcased a memorable performance like a well-oiled machine with incredible precision, timing, energy and momentum.</p>
<p>The performers had given their all&hellip; and then some, and they had received much appreciation and a tremendous applause.</p>
<p>Well done students and teachers of Amra Tari for sustaining the Certificate of Distinction for SYF once again!</p>
