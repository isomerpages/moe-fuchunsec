<p>The Fuchun Secondary School Concert Band has had its humble beginnings shortly after the school's inception in 1986. Since then, the band has performed in various concerts, and more recently, has also clinched a respectable and well-earned Certificate of Accomplishment at the 2017 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for Concert Bands. In 2018, the band had performed in Fuchun Fiesta 2018, showing an impressive display of unity in playing a piece for the musical. This year, the band will once again aim to achieve a greater level of achievement in the SYF Arts Presentation. The band is also involved in various VIA projects on a yearly basis.</p>
<p><strong><u>OUR ACHIEVEMENTS</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 201 - Certificate of Accomplishment</li>
<li>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2017 - Certificate of Accomplishment</li>
<li>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2015 - Certificate of Commendation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2019<br /></u></strong>The Concert Band had put in many months of effort to prepare for the challenge for the year 2019, as their conductors had chosen a very engaging musical piece as their choice piece. Through all the sweat, blood and tears, they had managed to give their best in the performance on that day of reckoning, even though their nerves were flayed and stomachs filled with butterflies. Their combined effort allowed them to achieve the Certificate of Commendation. A testament to their hard work! We look forward to getting ready for the next Presentation in 2021!</p>
<p><strong><u>Fuchun Fiesta 2018<br /></u></strong>The Concert Band had practised for months to prepare for their public concert performance in front of a live audience! They had played an important supporting role in the musical by creating suspense, which was crucial for the plot. Without a way to communicate with each other while seated silently in front of the stage, the band members had to rely on the gestures of their conductor and fellow members to know the cues needed to play their musical instruments in unison. The band received much applause, which topped the wonderful experience our Concert Band members had to play for their family and friends. Job well done, Concert Band!</p>

<p><strong><u>VIA @ ROMP 2018<br /></u></strong>The Concert Band had given their all in putting up a performance for the second year for the Harvest Care Centre&rsquo;s ROMP 2018 Sport Carnival. Right at the start of Term 3, the Concert Band members took time to hone their skills in playing the pieces to ensure that they will be able to put up an entertaining performance. A short &lsquo;romp&rsquo; (pun intended) to the snack carnival metres away was a bonus to their hard work that day. Here&rsquo;s to next year&rsquo;s!</p>

<p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival 2017<br /></u></strong>The Concert Band was well-prepared to display a note-worthy performance in&nbsp;SYF 2017. They had done well, performing with nuance and sophistication,&nbsp;bringing each and every music segment in their ensemble to life. The&nbsp;performance was musically convincing and the performers showed a great&nbsp;improvement this year in listening across the ensemble to play cohesively&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>This improved collaboration as well as a good sense of individual&nbsp;responsibility had been one of the several factors which had attributed to the&nbsp;encouraging and improved achievement for the Concert Band this year. Great&nbsp;strategy and teamwork for both students and teachers!</p>
