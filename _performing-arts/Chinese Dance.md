<p><strong><u>Introduction<br /></u></strong>Chinese dance in Fuchun Secondary School started back in 2008. Our current instructor is Ms. Dang Qi who has a vast and rich experience in both the performance and coaching of Chinese dance. Currently we have over 20 members in the club who chose to join Chinese Dance out of their appreciation for the Chinese culture and the passion to nurture their potential in Chinese dance as well as other dance genres.</p>
</div>
<p>Apart from coaching the students in traditional Chinese dance aesthetics, the students are encouraged to explore contemporary dance and choreography as part of their dance development. As part of the mission to nurture the students&rsquo; character anchored on our school ICARE values (Integrity, Camaraderie, Adaptability, Responsibility and Excellence), the students are given the opportunities to improve their skills through constant reflection on their own learning, team work and performance. On top of that, the students are expected to display high level of discipline and responsibility by keeping up with their punctuality and attendance. We also provide platforms to foster students&rsquo; leadership qualities and their strength of character.</p>
<p>In the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) competition which took place in April 2019, our students spent months of training to perform a challenging and technically demanding dance item. The students have gone the extra miles by putting in the extra effort beyond what is required. With their high level of commitment and enthusiasm, our dancers have done us proud by clinching the certificate of accomplishment in SYF.</p>
