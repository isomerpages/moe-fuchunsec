<p><strong>True to self<br /></strong>The school crest is designed in a stylised "F" to represent the name of the school and the flame of truth.</p>
<p>The three little steps beside the flame signify that truth is not always easy to express and must therefore be taken "step-by-step".</p>
<p>The red colour of the crest symbolises courage to speak the truth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Upon the shoulders of all<br />Rest the task of discerning truth<br />And remaining true to oneself<br />In all we say and do<br />Say and do</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Chorus:<br />Fuchun, you're our guide and mentor<br />Within your boundaries we extend our horizon<br />With what we learn<br />To prepare us for what's beyond<br />Fuchun, you're our guiding star<br />(Fuchun, you're our guiding star)<br />We pledge to serve as one<br />Along the pathway of Honour and Truth<br />And to serve with loyalty to school and nation</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Repeat chorus</p>
