<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1986: Humble Beginning<br /></strong><strong>&ldquo;Always Learning, Always Growing&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<img src="/images/history1.png">
<p>Fuchun started on 2nd January 1986 with 9 teachers and a student population of 109. The responsibility of establishing a mission and an identity for the school rested squarely on the shoulders of the pioneer principal, Mrs Ngiam Geak Kim and her staff of nine teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission<br /></strong>To develop each student to his or her fullest potential, producing an educated and caring individual who is adaptable and innovative with a zest for living a full, productive and spiritually meaningful life, contributing much to the well-being of Singapore and giving loyal service to the country</p>
<p><strong>Our Crest<br /></strong>The school crest is designed in a stylised &lsquo;F&rsquo; to represent the name of the school and the flame of the truth. The three little steps beside the flame signify that truth is not always easy to express and must therefore be taken &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo;. The red colour of the crest symbolizes courage to uphold the school motto &ldquo;<strong>TRUE TO SELF</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Our Motto<br /></strong>The school motto &lsquo;True to Self&rsquo; urges students to imbibe the qualities of honesty and moral integrity. It is an expression of the one true quality that governs the students&rsquo; behavior in all aspects of school life and beyond. To develop caring and responsible leaders of tomorrow, our students must be truthful and upright citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision<br /></strong>The school vision was &lsquo;Always Learning and Always Growing&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1990-1995<br /></strong><strong>&ldquo;IT for the first time in teaching&rdquo;</strong></p>
<img src="/images/history2.png">
<p><strong>1991<br /></strong>Fuchun set up the first Lower Secondary Macintosh laboratory. Teachers used IT for the first time in teaching Mathematics. Students went through an IT programme where they learned to use MacDraw, Word and Excel programmes.</p>
<p><strong>1992<br /></strong>Fuchun was placed second for value-addedness in the Special/Express stream among 139 secondary schools in the first ranking of schools by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Fuchun participated for the first time in the Singapore Youth Festival with a mass dance by the Lower Secondary girls. They also performed at the National Day Celebrations.</p>
<p>The first school newsletter, the Fuchun News was produced and circulated in January.</p>
<p><strong>1993<br /></strong>Fuchun students made a special delivery to their cherished teacher and Vice-Principal Miss Aileen Lau, who was battling cancer. This inspired her to write the poem &lsquo;One Thousand Paper Cranes&rsquo; that was later published in her collection of poems &lsquo;Face to Faith&rsquo; and recited on a programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Thousand Paper Cranes<br /></strong>By Miss Aileen Lau<br />One thousand paper cranes<br />You said the class would make.<br />I smiled at your earnestness.<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the number for good luck<br />According to a Japanese legend,&rdquo;<br />You piped on:<br />&ldquo;And cranes symbolise long life.&rdquo;<br />That touched me to the core &ndash;<br />Having been twice struck by cancer.<br />&ldquo;We will make you one thousand cranes!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You will get better,&rdquo;<br />You promised with all your might.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At home recuperating, I imagine<br />All forty-two pairs of hands busy<br />Manly hands cutting tiny squares of colour<br />Under the dark brown desks<br />While heads look up in attention<br />And gentle caring feminine fingers<br />Folding each square intricately<br />To form the delicate crane</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A visit for Teachers&rsquo; Day<br />And I&rsquo;m given a big yellow bag.<br />Opening it I find<br />One thousand tiny colourful paper cranes.<br />My eyes filled with tears<br />You kept your promise.<br />My heart bursts with hope<br />I will get better.</p>
<p>Fuchun and Mrs Ngiam were featured in the maiden issue of the &lsquo;Care Connection&rsquo;, a newsletter published by the Pastoral Care and Career Guidance Section of the Ministry of Education. The article had a headline that read &ldquo;You are loved at Fuchun&rdquo;, which described Fuchun as a &lsquo;typical neighbourhood school&rsquo; where pupils were fortunate to be &lsquo;cherished by the principal, teachers and schoolmates&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>1994<br /></strong>There were many improvements in the teaching facilities. Each classroom was installed with a television and a video-cassette recorder.</p>
<p>In April, the school mourned the loss of her Vice-Principal, Miss Aileen Lau, who succumbed to cancer. An English and Literature teacher, she had a distinguished teaching and research career. In 1993, she was awarded the National Day Efficiency Medal. Today we remember her for her unceasing efforts and great commitment in teaching the students of Fuchun. We commemorate this exceptional teacher by awarding annually the Aileen Lau Book Prize to students who demonstrate a commendable love for reading.</p>
<p><strong>1995<br /></strong>This was the year when the school initiated work experience for our students. A group of Secondary Three students worked with the Singapore Zoological Gardens during the November holidays. Since then, our students have had the opportunity to be involved in work experience at Baxter Healthcare Private Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1996-1999<br /></strong><strong>&ldquo;The Most Improved Neighbourhood School&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1996<br /></strong>The school bade farewell to Mrs Ngiam, who joined East Secondary school and welcomed Mr Johari Mohd Rais as the new principal.&nbsp;Fuchun had the distinction of being awarded the title of &ldquo;The Most Improved Neighbourhood School&rdquo; in .&nbsp;A booming student population made it necessary for the school to function in two sessions for the first time.&nbsp;The school also celebrated her 10th anniversary with the staging of the dance drama entitled &ldquo;Kojiki&rdquo;. The dance movements of Kojiki mirrored the life of students in Fuchun. The movements symbolized the periods of harmony and discord, similar to the episodes of struggles and conflicts students experience in pursuit of their goals.</p>
<p><strong>1997<br /></strong>The piling work for the extension block began in August 1997 and construction began in December that year.</p>
<p><strong>1998<br /></strong>The extension building was completed in November 1998. The extension block boasts 2 full computer labs, 3 IT-enabled rooms, 9 classrooms, 6 special rooms and 3 CCA rooms.
