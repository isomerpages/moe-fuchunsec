Dear Parents, Teachers and The Young Ladies and Gentlemen of Fuchun Secondary Secondary,&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, let me just say that it is indeed an honour and a privilege for me to have joined the Fuchun Secondary School family. The school’s reputation precedes itself and I have heard many wonderful things about it, its students, its staff as well as its culture of care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first few days in the school have affirmed what I have heard - the warmth of the welcome proffered by both staff and pupils alike has been overwhelming. The smiles, friendliness and not to mention the eagerness to tell me all about the school clearly show a great sense of belonging and pride that all feel for the school. I am blessed to have been given an opportunity to be a part of such an amazing, close-knit and vibrant school community. I am eager to begin my journey with the FCS family and look forward to the great times that I am sure we will go through together in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each new school year brings joy, excitement, and anticipation for all. I am confident that on top of new beginnings, the FCS tradition of making everyone that enters the school feel welcomed, cared for, loved and safe will continue. The commitment to meet the needs of pupils and to make available opportunities to explore and grow will be as strong as ever. FCS will strive to provide the best for its charges and will make every effort to develop its pupils into thinking, confident, self-directed, life-long learners as well as leaders of their own learning and with others. We will guide our young ladies and gentlemen to be an explorer of life, globally aware and yet rooted as upright and concerned citizens with a strong sense of belonging. Of course, these require the support and cooperation of all - parents, teachers and pupils. A commitment to high standards and expectations of students in academic performance, co-curricular participation, behaviour and discipline is a must if we are to create an exceptional learning community, one where every individual finds the educational experience enriching, enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>
<p>Parents, teachers and young ladies and gentlemen of FCS, as the new year beckons, let us link our hands together and travel down the educational journey with a single heart, mind and direction. Together, we can bring FCS to greater heights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wishing all of you a wonderful school year,<br>Shawal<br>Principal<br>Fuchun Secondary School<br>“True to Self”</p>
