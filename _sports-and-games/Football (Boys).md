<p><strong><u>Motto<br></u></strong><em>Together Everyone Achieves More</em></p>

In our Football CCA, we aim to provide students with an enriching and holistic experience. Through our training, we aim to build a team of responsible players who are motivated to help one another to achieve excellence. They will grow physical and mentally as they go through the various fitness and tactical drills, which they will apply in football competitions. Beyond the pitch, the players will also develop empathy by engaging in community activities. We believe that all our members will have fond memories of their CCA at the end of their secondary school life
